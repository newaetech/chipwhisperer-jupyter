    "When testing software, it can be extremely helpful to view and modify the state of the software while it is running. For programs running on fully featured operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), this can be accomplished by using debugging programs, such as `gdb`. Microcontrollers and FPGAs, on the other hand, require additional hardware to debug. While it is better to use a device dedicated to debugging, beginning with ChipWhisperer 5.6.1, you can use your ChipWhisperer capture board to debug target devices. This is done over SWD/JTAG, which most devices support. To see if your target supports JTAG/SWD, you should check the reference manual/datasheet for its microcontroller.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will run will show you how to set your hardware up for debugging, how to set the software up for debugging, and finally how to program and debug an STM32F3. In addition to this demo, you may want to skip through and have open our [debugging documentation](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging.html)."
