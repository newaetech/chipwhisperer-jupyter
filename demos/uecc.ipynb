    "## Background\n",
    "To get the most out of this tutorial, some basic knowledge of elliptic curves, and in particular of point multiplication on elliptic curves, is required. A good overview is available here: https://cryptojedi.org/peter/data/eccss-20130911b.pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The side-channel attack presented here targets the scalar multiplier $k$ in the elliptic curve point multiplication. Point multiplication is the most expensive operation in many (if not all?) cryptographic uses of elliptic curves. The secret scalar is not the private key, but learning the scalar used in an ECDSA signature (for example) allows the private key to be trivially calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack is quite different from the AES side-channel attacks in our other tutorials. In most ECC point multiplication implementations (including the target used here), the secret scalar $k$ is processed one bit at a time. At a high level, the attack is very simple:\n",
    "1. Identify when each bit of $k$ is processed on the power trace.\n",
    "2. Find how processing a '1' is different from processing a '0'.\n",
    "3. Assemble the secret $k$, one bit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty in attacking ECC is that there are a lot of different point multiplication algorithms, and so there isn't a single straightforward way to do the above steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are attacking $k$ one bit at a time, its size has no impact on the difficulty of the attack. The curve used in this attack is the NIST P-256 curve; the same approach would work just as well with a larger curve. (In fact for some attacks, a larger curve can be beneficial, since it allows for more observations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our attack requires multiple traces to be collected. The secret $k$ remains constant for each trace, but a different point must be used for each trace. However, we require no knowledge whatsoever of what the points actually are (which means that point blinding, a common countermeasure -- see [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48059-5_25) for example -- would not be effective against this attack). Furthermore, if the attacker is limited to collecting a single trace for a given value of $k$, we will show in the end that we can correctly guess most of $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target for this attack is the popular [micro-ecc](https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc) library. We target directly the point multiplication implemented by its `uECC_point_mult` function, for the NIST P-256 (secp256r1) curve."

    "\n",
    "Most of the capture settings used below are similar to the standard ChipWhisperer scope settings. Some important points to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The full ECC operation takes approximately 6 million clock cycles, so it is best done with a ChipWhisperer-Pro or Husky...\n",
    "- ...but if you don't have a CW-Pro, and you have patience, it's also possible to run this with a ChipWhisperer-Lite. Every trace needs to be captured in several steps, using the sample offset feature (246 steps to be precise!), so trace acquisition is **much** slower: around 8 minutes/trace. The attack does not require a very large number of traces, but the initial profiling step will take over 13 hours. It's possible to skip this step by using the results provided in this tutorial. Then, the attack itself requires 20 traces, which is a more reasonable 2.5 hours (skip ahead to the \"The Attack\" section).\n",
    "- To use a CW-lite, replace `capture_ecc_trace()` calls with `capture_ecc_trace_cwlite()`.\n",
    "- It's possible that better results would be obtained with x4 sampling, but that would make trace acquisition with the CW-lite *very* slow!\n"

    "\n",
    "Since there are many ways to implement point multiplication, the first step towards an attack is understanding the target implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the micro-ecc code is well-commented, and [line 749 of uECC.c](https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc/blob/24c60e243580c7868f4334a1ba3123481fe1aa48/uECC.c#L749) points us directly to what we need to know: the implementation follows algorithm 9 of https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/338.pdf. This saves us from reversing the algorithm from the C code (or worse, from the power trace itself: see [this paper](https://ninjalab.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/a_side_journey_to_titan.pdf) for a great example of a black-box reversing of ECC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target firmware calls the `uECC_point_mult()` function, which has three inputs: the curve (not a secret), the base point on the curve (not a secret), and the secret scalar multiplier $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$k$ is then *regularized* by the `regularize_k()` function, which essentially adds the curve order to $k$. It is this regularized $k$, which we'll denote $k_r$, that the main multiplication loop iterates on, and so this is what our attack will retrieve. The following functions allow you to go from the input $k$ to the regularized $k_r$ (and vice-versa):"

    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we're picking up on differences which are due to the different points, not differences which are due to different values of k. If we averaged a much larger number of traces, it's possible that the differences which now show up when the traces are unaligned would average out to zero. But, from what we know of the multiplication algorithm, we know the differences between 0 and 1 are going to be very small, so let's focus on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, these are the start/stop ranges that we'll use for each of the four combinations of realignment point and function call, along with the thresholds that we'll use to select points of interest:\n",

    "| realignment | function | start | stop | threshold |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These thresholds were picked in a somewhat ad-hoc intuitive manner. From what we know of the code, we expect the secret leakage to be limited to very few instructions, so we selected thresholds which filter all but the highest peaks, so that we don't end up with too many points of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't necessarily the optimal values, but as we'll soon see, they mostly work quite well. Once you've gone through the attack, come back here and experiment with different thresholds -- you may be able to improve the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is why we adjusted our offsets to be positive a few cells back: otherwise, the start/stop ranges could be different from run to run. That's not necessarily a problem, but it would require you to manually select appropriate start and stop points, which could be error-prone. By adjusting the offsets, we've established a common ground, and the default settings should work everytime.\n",

    "It may also possible to refine the attack (e.g. finding the very best POI). This attack uses an ad-hoc approach which is able to find fairly good POI (at least most of the time), but these are by no means garanteed to be optimal. Sometimes you may get lucky: the best result seen from running this notebook is a successfui 2-trace attack. This is tantalizingly close to a single-trace attack!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this attack, success with a single trace is a big deal. This is because this attack requires that all traces use the same $k$. But in ECDSA, $k$ is a nonce -- it's not supposed to be used more than once. So this attack is not entirely realistic if it requires multiple traces. But it does show how much margin there is for a single-trace attack to work. And that's not all: notice that the single trace results tend to have as few as 40 wrong bit guesses. This suggests that many of the bits could be reliably guessed. If we can determine with high probability which bits can be guessed correctly, the **Hidden Number Problem** (HNP) can be applied.\n",
