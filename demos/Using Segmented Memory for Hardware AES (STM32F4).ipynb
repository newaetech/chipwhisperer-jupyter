    "# Segmented Buffer Example\n",

    "The segmented buffer splits the ChipWhisperer-Lite/Pro sample buffer (24K/100K) into little segments. When you are doing a capture of small traces (such as with Hardware AES), you end up with a case where our buffer looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "                [ ~~~~~~................................................... ]\n",
    "                     |                      |\n",
    "    One power trace -+        Empty Space --+\n",
    "   \n",
    "We need to have the overhead of unload the buffer for that little bit of data. With segmented capture, we instead do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "                [ ~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~~~~~~|~ ]\n",
    "                    |       |              \\ /                            |\n",

    "    Power traces 3..4..etc -----------------+\n",
    "    \n",
    "We'll show an example of this with the STM32F415 device.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will require a special operating mode that re-runs encryptions a number of times, so we don't have the serial protocol overhead (which would slow our capture down). You may want to modify the firmware to have less overhead in calling the hardware AES core as well.\n",
