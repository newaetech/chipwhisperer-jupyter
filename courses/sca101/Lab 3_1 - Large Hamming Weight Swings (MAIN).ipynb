In the case of a simple password check, this allowed us to see how many characters of the password we had correct, eventually resulting in the password being broken.*\n",

    "* Try setting multiple bytes to 0x00 and 0xFF.\n",
    "* Try using smaller hamming weight differences. Is the spike still distinct? What about if you capture more traces?\n",
    "* We focused on the first byte here. Try putting the difference plots for multiple different bytes on the same plot.\n",
    "* The target is running AES here. Can you get the spikes to appear in different places if you set a byte in a later round of AES (say round 5) to 0x00 or 0xFF?\n",

    "One other note that might trip you out: rememeber you are measuring the voltage at the input to ChipWhisperer, which is measured across a shunt resistor. The end result of this is that a lower voltage actually means more power. So you might see the spikes flipped from the \"expected\" direction based on a 1 taking more power than a 0."
