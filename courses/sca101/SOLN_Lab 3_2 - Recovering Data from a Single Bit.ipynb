    "Finally, finish off this loop by adding your leakage function into it. Running the loop should print results for each bit option - hopefully you see that only the matching bit shows the full number of matches. If you want to try a different leaky bit, you'll then need to go back up to the actual secret observation to make the leak happen from a different bit. But you can see the following code makes no assumptions about 'bit 0' being the leaky one - it will work with any other bit leaking now.\n",
