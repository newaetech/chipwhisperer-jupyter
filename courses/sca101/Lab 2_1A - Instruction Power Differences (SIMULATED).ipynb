    "Which sends a simpleserial command to the target and captures a power trace. For the hardware, it's up to you to edit the firmware, build it, and upload it before capturing each trace. We can't do that, so we need to load some trace data and mimic the `capture_trace()` calls. You can use it in mostly the same way, but one caveat is that which trace is returned changes with each call. You can select a specific trace with the `idx` parameter."
