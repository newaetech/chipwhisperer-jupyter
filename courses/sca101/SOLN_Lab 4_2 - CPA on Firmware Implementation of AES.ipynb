    "**SUMMARY**: *By now, you'll have used a DPA attack to break AES. While this method has its place in side channel attacks, it often requires a large number of traces to break AES and can suffer from additional issues like ghost peaks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*We've also learned in the previous lab that there is a very linear relationship between the hamming weight of the SBox output and the power consumption at that point. Instead of checking average power consumption over many traces to see if a guessed subkey is correct, we can instead check if our guessed subkey also has this linear relationship with the device's power consumption across a set of traces. Like with DPA, we'll need to repeat this measurement at each point in time along the power trace.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*To get an objective measurement of how linear this relationship is, we'll be developing some code to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**\n",
    "* Developing an algorithm based on a mathematical description\n",
    "* Verify that correlation can be used to break a single byte of AES\n",
    "* Extend the single byte attack to the rest of the key"

    "1. Currently, the loop needs to go through all the traces before it can return a correlation. This isn't too bad for a short attack, for a much longer one (think 10k+ traces) we won't get any feedback from the attack until it's finished. Also, if we didn't capture enough traces for the attack, the entire analysis calculation needs to be repeated! Instead of using the original correlation equation, we can instead use an equivalent \"online\" version that can be easily updated with more traces: $$r_{i,j} = \\frac{D\\sum_{d=1}^{D}h_{d,i}t_{d,j}-\\sum_{d=1}^{D}h_{d,i}\\sum_{d=1}^{D}t_{d,j}}{\\sqrt{((\\sum_{d=1}^Dh_{d,i})^2-D\\sum_{d=1}^Dh_{d,i}^2)-((\\sum_{d=1}^Dt_{d,j})^2-D\\sum_{d=1}^Dh_{d,j}^2)}}$$\n",

    "| t | traces | traces | \n",
    "\n",
    "2. There's a lot more we can learn from the attack other than the key. For example, we could plot how far away the correct key guess is from the top spot (called the partial guessing entropy or PGE) vs. how many traces we used, giving us a better idea of how many traces we needed to actually recover the correct key. We also might want to plot how correlation for a given key guess changes over time.\n",

    "This \"online\" correlation equation is the one that the subject of the next tutorial, ChipWhisperer Analyzer, actually uses. It also provides functions and methods for gathering and plotting some interesting statistics."
