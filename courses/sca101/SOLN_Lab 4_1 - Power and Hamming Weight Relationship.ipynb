We could just pick a trace and subtract it from each group, but subtracting an average of all the traces instead will make the plot more distinct. Even better would be to have an even weighting between all of the hamming weight groups, since the extreme hamming weights (0 and 8) are far less common than the middle values, but this won't end up being super necessary (though you can still attempt this if you'd like).
