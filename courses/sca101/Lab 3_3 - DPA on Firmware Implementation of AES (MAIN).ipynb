    "\n",
    "*Next, we'll see how to use power analysis instead of an actual bit value. With this technique, the goal is to separate the traces by a bit in the result of the SBox output (it doesn't matter which one): if that bit is 1, its group of traces should, on average, have higher power consumption during the SBox operation than the other set.*\n",
