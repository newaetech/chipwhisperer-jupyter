    "## Background\n",
    "To get the most out of this tutorial, some basic knowledge of elliptic curves, and in particular of point multiplication on elliptic curves, is required. A good overview is available here: https://cryptojedi.org/peter/data/eccss-20130911b.pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The side-channel attack presented here targets the scalar multiplier (\"k\") in the elliptic curve point multiplication. Point multiplication is the most expensive operation in many (if not all?) cryptographic uses of elliptic curves. The secret scalar is not the private key, but learning the scalar used in an ECDSA signature (for example) allows the secret key to be trivially calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack is quite different from the AES side-channel attacks in our other tutorials. In most ECC point multiplication implementations (including the target used here), the secret scalar k is consumed one bit at a time. At a high level, the attack is very simple:\n",
    "1. Identify when each bit of k is processed on the power trace.\n",
    "2. Find how processing a '1' is different from processing a '0'.\n",
    "3. Assemble the secret k, one bit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are attacking k one bit at a time, its size has no impact on the difficulty of the attack. The curve used in this attack is the NIST P-256 curve; the same approach would work just as well with a larger curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our attack requires multiple traces to be collected. The secret k remains constant for each trace, but a different point must be used for each trace. However, we require no knowledge whatsoever of what the points actually are. Furthermore, if the attacker is limited to collecting a single trace for a given value of k, we will show in the end that we can correctly guess most of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target for this attack is the point multiplication submodule of the [Cryptech ecdsa256 core](https://wiki.cryptech.is/log/user/shatov/ecdsa256).\n",
    "Refer to the README in your ChipWhisperer repository (`hardware/victims/cw305_artixtarget/fpga/cryptosrc/cryptech/ecdsa256-v1/README.md`) for details on the target and the modifications that were made to it for this attack."

    "This tutorial is the first part of a 5-part series. In this tutorial, we develop a basic attack and demonstrate its viability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 improves the attack and introduces new ways to measure its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 3, we switch from the attacker chair to the defender chair: we propose and evaluate several countermeasures to resist our attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 4, we study one more countermeasure which yields new insights on the target's leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 5 concludes by looking at what TVLA can tell us about the target's leakage, with the benefit of all that we learned in the previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only do part 1, you'll learn quite a bit about hardware ECC and how it may be attacked, and you could choose to stop there. Hopefully you'll find this sufficiently interesting to cover the remaining sections and learn even more!"

    "## Capture Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the capture settings used below are similar to the standard ChipWhisperer scope settings. Some important points to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The full ECC operation takes over one million clock cycles, so it is best done with a ChipWhisperer-Pro or Husky.\n",
    "- With a ChipWhisperer-Lite, every trace needs to be captured in several steps, using the sample offset feature (47 steps to be precise!), so trace acquisition is much slower: around 5 seconds/trace, versus 4 traces/second with the CW-pro. Be patient! Luckily, the attack doesn't require a large number of traces.\n",
    "- It's possible that better results would be obtained with x4 sampling, but that would make trace acquisition with the CW-lite *very* slow.\n"

    "## Supported Setups\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires a CW305 or CW312T-A35 target, and either a CW-Lite (two-part), CW-Pro or CW-Husky.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial was developed with a CW-Pro and the CW305 100t FPGA; the observations made in the attack's development will be accurate if you're using the same, but other combinations of capture and target hardware can diverge and may require some modifications to the attack code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same holds if you re-build the FPGA bitfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CW312T_A35 notes:\n",
    "- More traces may be required for the attacks to succeed.\n",
    "- Some of the observations with respect to the efficacy of countermeasures (in parts 3 onwards) won't line up exactly with what you observe.\n",
    "- The CW312T_A35-specific settings that are used assume the use of the inductive shunt; if you're using a different shunt, some tweaks will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CW-Lite notes:\n",
    "- Your results may not correspond exactly to the notebook's comments, especially in the first attempt when using the power measured on specific clock cycles. This is likely due to the 5x higher clock frequency being used, which is done to keep the trace acquisition time reasonable.\n",
    "- In the end, the final attack works well with the CW-lite, although it tends to require a few more traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have hardware, you can still follow along using the provided pre-recorded traces (set `TRACES` to `\"SIMULATED\"`). Because this is ECC and traces are so large (the full target operation takes 1.2 million cycles), most saved traces are not full traces of the ECC operation; they are segmented traces (chopped up subsets of full traces, keeping only the parts needed for the attack). Additionally, many of the results shown in this series of notebooks are also presented in the [Ark of the ECC eprint paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1520.pdf).\n",

    "You may have noticed that the point that the target core is tasked to multiply is given with $(x,y)$ coordinates. Why is there a $z$ coordinate now in the source code? Without fully reversing the implementation, it's safe to assume that the target takes the given point from its *affine* $(x,y)$ coordinates and transforms it into *projective* $(x,y,z)$ coordinates. Many (most?) ECC implementations do this because point multiplication is faster in projective coordinates (https://www.nayuki.io/page/elliptic-curve-point-addition-in-projective-coordinates gives a good overview of this).\n",

If you stare at it for a few minutes you should recognize that the write timings are *identical* for every bit of k, except for the last set of writes which are blocked whenever `move_inhibit` is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now make a pretty safe guess that the multiplication algorithm used is **double and always add**. Point multiplication in general consists of repeated doublings and adds. In this implementation, for each bit of k, the intermediate result goes through a point doubling and a point add; the result of the point add is discarded if the addition is not required, which is dependent on the value of the k bit being processed. `move_inhibit` is the logic which controls this discarding. This multiplication algorithm is a simple way to achieve time-constant execution, and, depending on implementation details, make it harder for side-channel attacks to identify whether the secret bit being processed is a 1 or a 0.\n",

    "We now have a decent (and hopefully correct!) understanding of the implementation.

Recall that 4202 is the clock cycle where we noted a statistical difference between processing a 1 versus a 0!\n",

    "We know from our first attempt that looking at only the last set of writes doesn't lead to a clean attack. But now that we understand what's happening at those clock cycles, we can try something else to leverage the leakage that we've found. On the simulation waveform, we can look at the next time that the `bram_1rw_1ro_readfirst` memory instances are read (after the possibly blocked memory write). Here's the idea: if `move_inhibit` was not set, then the next memory read will return what was written at cycles 4195-4203; otherwise, it will return something else. The correlation between the power samples at those two points in time might be able to tell us whether `move_inhibit` was set or not."
