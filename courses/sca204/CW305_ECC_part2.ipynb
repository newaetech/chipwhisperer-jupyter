    "# The Hidden Number Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we are not done: it turns out that if you correctly guess enough bits and repeat this many times (i.e. make a lot of single-trace guesses, each for a different $k$), you can recover a full $k$ even if you could only guess a handful of bits for any given trace. This is thanks to the **Hidden Number Problem** (HNP). We won't go into the details of it because it's not simple, but HNP is a well-known and commonly used approach for side-channel analysis of public-key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent paper which used this technique is [A Side Journey to Titan](https://ninjalab.io/a-side-journey-to-titan/) from Ninjalabs. We follow their approach, which consists of collecting a large number of traces and keeping only the traces which meet at least one of the following conditions:\n",
    "1. at least three runs of 3 correct consecutive bit guesses\n",
    "2. at least two runs of 4 correct consecutive bit guesses\n",
    "3. at least one runs of 5 correct consecutive bit guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "We leave the actual solving of the HNP as a (non-trivial!) exercise to the reader; we finish here by seeing what is the percentage of traces that meet the above conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a good estimate, we need to collect a large number of traces. Since the traces are long, and yet we only care about $4 \\times 256 = 1024$ measurements from each 1.2 million point trace, it makes sense to modify our trace capture function to only save the points of interest from each trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Husky, we can get faster captures by using the new timed segmented feature. This also allows us to turn off streaming mode, which means that the target clock could be increased for even faster captures (we don't do this here, and if you do, you'll have to re-establish the decision thresholds). The timed segmented capture works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, `scope.adc.segments` sets the number of segments to capture: 256 (one segment for each bit of $k$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, `scope.adc.segment_cycles` sets the interval at which we want to capture segments: 4204, the processing time for one bit, so that each segments starts at the same time index within the bit processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `scope.adc.samples` sets the number of samples to collect *per segment*: 10 (for a total of 10 * `scope.adc.segments` = 2560 samples).\n",
    "```\n",
    "        scope.adc.segments = 256\n",
    "        scope.adc.segment_cycles = 4204\n",
    "        scope.adc.samples = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also set `scope.adc.offset` so that we capture the samples we are interested (e.g. our `poi` samples: `[6, 7, 4202, 4203]`); in this case we set it to 42 (start of first bit) + 4202 (offset into POI sample number 4202 within the bit) + 3 (Husky ADC offset). Then, once the segmented trace has been captured, we reconstruct a trace which retains only the four POI samples for each bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the care taken to record only the required power samples, pre-recorded traces for this step would be too large; so you'll need the required hardware to run this."
