    "Throughout SCA101 (and even SCA201), we've focused exclusively on unauthenticated encryption. In real systems, this is often a very bad idea. If you're interested, the following blog post outlines some basic attacks on unauthenticated encryption: https://cybergibbons.com/reverse-engineering-2/why-is-unauthenticated-encryption-insecure/.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our bootloader example, it would be catastrophic if we were able to modify the resulting firmware. We could then, for example, inject malicious code to dump out the firmware or encryption key. To try to prevent this, our target appends a message authentication code to each encrypted frame in an [Encrypt-then-MAC scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption#Encrypt-then-MAC). To keep things simple, the \"hash function\" is just an 8-bit CRC. When calculating the MAC (Message Authentication Code), the ciphertext is appended to a 64-bit key. Note  that this scheme is **not** secure; however, it is simple and it lets us reuse code from other parts of ChipWhisperer. In total, the whole frame this looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 16 bytes of encrypted (AES128-CBC) firmware\n",
    "* 1 byte MAC\n",
    "\n",
    "The frame is then wrapped in our standard SimpleSerial packet we'll be using the 'p' command (or 0x01 on SSV2) to send \n",
