    "## The Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got our feet wet with glitching, we're going to try something a bit more realistic: an \"encrypted\" bootloader (it's actually just rot-13, but we'll pretend it's unbreakable encryption), where we make as few assumptions as possible. Our goal will be to get that bootloader to decrypt the data and send it back to us. Here's what we know about the bootloader:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `'p'` command is used to write encrypted firmware to the device. It takes in an encrypted ASCII-encoded string, terminated with a newline. Our first chunk of firmware is `\"516261276720736265747267206762206f686c207a76797821\"`.\n",
    "1. It does *something* to it (presumably unencrypts it, authenticates it, etc. and writes it to memory)\n",
    "1. It sends back an error code of `\"r000000\\n\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Of immediate interest is that error code. That's the only time the bootloader communicates back with us, so attacking there is a good place to start. One thing that we'll assume is that we've got a trigger right before the error code is sent back to us. This is just a simple `trigger_high()` call, but we could also trigger on an IO line (better with the CW1200 Pro) or with a SAD trigger on a power trace (CW1200 Pro only). We've got a place to start, but let's see if we can learn more about the bootloader first."

    "As you can see by the output, the bootloader has suffered a pretty catastrophic failure! Not only has it spilled the secret, it's also dumped a whole bunch more memory. For a real bootloader, there's probably some pretty juicy stuff in there like encryption keys or previously decrypted firmware. Let's start by taking a look at the C source code that sends the error code back:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "That last one seems to be our best theory, so let's go with that."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## The Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check the assembly for our booloader. No need to decompile the binary or recompile to assembly, since there's also a listing file created as part of the build process (`*.lss`). This file also contains C, so it makes it easy to search (try something like the `trigger_high()` call). You might notice that instead of doing a `less than or equal` or `less than` comparison like was in our C code, the compiler has instead inserted a `not equal` comparison instead! This means our original guess may not have been correct, as our assumption about what would happen if the last `i < ascii_idx` was skipped doesn't hold. In fact, it's a lot more likely that the last check was skipped (or i was set to some large value) than flipping a particular bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually a pretty unexpected change for the compiler to make, espcially since `less than`, `greater than`, and `not equal` are nearly identical instructions in terms of implementation and have both the same instruction size and speed. This showcases an important fact: the C code that you write is not directly translated to assembly. It needs to go through the compiler first, which may drastically change the intended logic of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what happened, let's look at some ways to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Volatile variables\n",
    "\n",
    "C includes a keyword for variables called `volatile`, which indicates that the variable may change between accesses and therefore should not have optimizations applied to it. A typical use case for `volatile` is for peripheral registers on embedded devices. It would be really bad, for example, if you were trying to wait for an IO pin to go high in your code, but the compiler decided it would be faster to only check it only once and assume it doesn't change!\n",
    "\n",
    "Try replacing `int i = 0;` before the print look with `volatile int i = 0;`, recompile, and check the listing file. Is there any other unexpected changes? What about if you consider the use case above (i.e. if `i` was a register instead of a loop variable)? Is there any way the attack might still work? If so, how might you mitigate this?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unrolling the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential way of solving this issue would be to manually unroll the loop. The message being printed by the bootloader is a constant length of 7 characters, so we could instead write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int i;\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "putch(ascii_buffer[i++]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this is something the compiler might do on its own to optimize the code, since unrolling a loop like this is faster than the loop version. It's not a good idea to blindly rely on this, however, since the compiler could choose not to make this optimization as well and might change it between builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Checking for invalid characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to consider is that the message from the bootloader only has a limited range of characters that it prints. We could instead construct a \"safe print\" function that only prints newlines, `'r'` and ASCII digits (i.e. `'0'` to `'9'`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int safe_print(char c)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if ((c == '\\n') ||\n",
    "       ((c >= '0') && (c <= '9')) ||\n",
    "       (c == 'r')) {\n",
    "        putch(c);\n",
    "        return 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return -1; //uh oh!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It we went this route, it would be a good idea to make the error return a separate buffer with a bunch of null characters at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. More generic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "More generic ways of defending against glitch attacks (memory guards, for example) are also discussed in the training slides."
