## Naming Notes

### Prefix

sca: Side Channel (Power) Analysis courses
fault: Fault Injection (Glitching) courses

### Numbering

* 1xx: Fundamentals. A 101 course is a prerequisite for all higher course.
* 2xx: Advanced topics. Dependencies noted in the labs/courses themselves.
* appx: Applications. Dependencies noted in the labs/courses themselves.

### Getting Started

We recommend going through sca101 before fault101, at least Lab 1_X and Lab 2_X. This will introduce you to the required ChipWhisperer software.
