    "We learned in Fault101 that fault injection can be used to bypass the final check and stay in a loop longer. Similarly, glitching can also be used to break out of a loop early. This is likely one of the effects that we saw when glitching past a password check in that course as well. That being said, it's up to the compiler how this loop gets translated to assembly. For example, `Nr` is constant here, so the compiler might decided to completely unroll the loop, preventing us from ever breaking free! For our glitch to work we really have three requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There actually needs to be a loop for us to break free from. The compiler can't unroll the loop.\n",
    "1. The registers need to line up properly such that, if we skip the loop, the last round still completes properly.\n",
    "1. The compiler can't skip the first `round < Nr` check. If the compiler doesn't know that `round` always starts off less than `Nr`, it needs to do a check at the start of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "unfortunately for us, while our default build of TINYAES128C will fulfill the first two requirements, if we look at the generated assembly from `simpleserial-aes-PLATFORM.lss` (CWLITEARM in this case):\n",
