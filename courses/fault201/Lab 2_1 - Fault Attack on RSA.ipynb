    "## Attack Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory for this attack is a bit simpler than the one for AES, so we'll take you through it here instead of putting it in another notebook. If you don't know, RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, meaning it has a public and private key, with one being used for encryption and the other for decryption. It can be used in both a public encryption/private decryption configuration and a private encryption/public decryption situation. We'll be attacking the latter case. Let's assume that the target is signing a message and is sending it to us so we can verify the identity of the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "For RSA, the public key is made up of two numbers, $n$ and $e$. The private key is made up of $n$ and $d$. These numbers have some special properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $n$ is constructed as the product of 2 prime numbers, $p$ and $q$.\n",
    "1. $d$ is derived from $p$, $q$, and $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these properties, a few things are evident:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we learn $p$ or $q$, we can derive the other prime number since $n$ is public information.\n",
    "1. If we learn $p$ and $q$, we can derive $d$ since $e$ is public information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target can encrypt/sign a message with the following equation ($s$ is the signature and $m$ is the message):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = m^d({mod}\\space n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can decrypt/verify the message with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^e = m(mod\\space n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with RSA is that it's very slow - these equations are simple, but they use massive numbers; if the numbers used are too small, it's trivial for a computer to factor $n$ into $p$ and $q$. $n$ for the firmware we're attacking is 1024 bits long, which is on the smaller size of secure keys at this point. This encryption/signing operation is especially slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of the signature verification equation is that the following is also true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(m - s^e)(mod\\space n) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "aka $(m - s^e)$ is divisible by $n$. It follows that $(m - s^e)$ is divisible by $p$ and $q$ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)\n",
    "\n",
    "To help speed up the encryption, an optimization known as the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) can be used. This theorem allows us derive two new exponents, $d_p$ and $d_q$, which are much smaller than $d$. We can then replace\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = m^d({mod}\\space n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with two equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_1 = m^{d_p}(mod\\ p) \\\\\n",
    "s_2 = m^{d_q}(mod\\ q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s$ is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i_q = q^{-1}mod\\ p \\\\\n",
    "s = s_2 + q(i_q(s_1 - s_2)mod\\ p)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s_1$ and $s_2$ can be combined into $s$ via CRT. Even though there's two modular exponentiations, this is still much faster since $d_p$ and $d_q$ are much smaller than $d$ and $p$ and $q$ are much smaller than $n$. This is the optimization that our target, which is using a slightly modified version of MBEDTLS (more on that in a bit), makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inserting a Fault\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that instead of everything going smoothly as above, a fault happens during the calculation of $s_2$, turning it into $s'_2$. $s_1$ and $s'_2$ will then be combined into $s'$. If that happens, a couple of things will be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When we go to verify the signature, it won't work: $s'^e \\neq m (mod\\ n)$. Concequently, $(m - s'^e)(mod\\space n) \\neq 0$, so $(m - s'^e)$ is not divisible by $n$\n",
    "1. Since $(m - s'^e)$ is not divisible by $n$, it cannot be divisible by both $p$ and $q$ anymore. Due to how the CRT works, it will still be divisible by $p$, but not by $q$. This can be expressed as $(m - s'^e) = pk$ for some integer $k$.  \n",
    "1. We now have $(m - s'^e) = pk$ and $n = pq$. This means that we can find $p$ by computing $gcd(m-s'^e, n)$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once we have $p$, we can compute $q = \\frac{n}{p}$ and $d$ via the rest of the RSA key generation algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The math is similar in the case that $s_1$ is faulted, with the only difference being that we recover $q$ at the end instead of $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating with the Target\n",
    "\n",
    "With the math out of the way, we can get to attacking the target:"

    "The crypto implementation we're attack isn't actually vulnerable to this attack without some additional glitching. This is because it verifies the signature is valid before sending it off. With a more complicated glitch setup, we could try glitching past it, but this is outside the scope of this lab. Some ideas include modifying the ChipWhisperer FPGA code to generate a second glitch, using a second ChipWhisperer (easiest if you were voltage glitching), and using a second trigger and trying to rearm between the two signature encryptions. You might even be able to increase the repeat and glitch near the end of the second encryption algorithm to glitch past both.\n",

From this one, you've seen an even more powerful attack is possible on the asymmetric cryptographic algorithm RSA-CRT that can recover the plaintext in a single fault. "
