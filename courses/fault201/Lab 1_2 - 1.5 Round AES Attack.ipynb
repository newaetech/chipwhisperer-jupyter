In the unmodified code, however, the lack of a check at the beginning of the loop prevented us from being able to skip the first round in AES. In this lab, we'll break the original code using an attack generated by https://github.com/cbouilla/AES-attacks-finder.*\n",

    "This attack is pretty specific to this implementation. What if, for example, we were able to break out at the same spot, but only the 2nd round key was used for the final AddRoundKey? In that case, we could run an attack with two plaintext faulted ciphertexts pairs, though it is much slower than the attack we did. Different situations will have different requirements, though attacks quickly become infeasible the further you get into AES (as you'd expect). The tool we used to generate the attack for this situation is available at https://github.com/cbouilla/AES-attacks-finder. If you're curious, try thinking up different glitch scenarios and use the tools to see if the attacks are possible! The tool outputs C code. In the case of this attack, the generated C code was ported to python with the help of `ctopy`."
