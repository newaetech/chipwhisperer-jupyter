    "**SUMMARY:** *Through the previous labs, we've gained a lot of tools to attack unknown embedded devices: SPA, DPA, CPA, trace resynchronization, and more. In this lab, we'll be using some of those techniques to break a more realistic target: a bootloader. Note that there are two versions of this lab. In this one (Lab B), we'll start with no information that couldn't be revealed by watching code be sent to the bootloader. Everything else, we'll need to figure out for ourselves, such as what encryption algorithm the target is using, how it's using it, etc. In lab A, this information will be given and you'll just focus on the attack. It's up to you whether you want to run this lab or Lab A!*\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of microcontrollers, a bootloader is a special piece of firmware that is made to let the user upload new programs into memory. This is especially useful for devices with complex code that may need to be patched or otherwise updated in the future - a bootloader makes it possible for the user to upload a patched version of the firmware onto the micro. The bootloader receives information from a communication line (a USB port, serial port, ethernet port, WiFi connection, etc...) and stores this data into program memory. Once the full firmware has been received, the micro can happily run its updated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one big security issue to worry about with bootloaders. A company may want to stop their customers from writing their own firmware and uploading it onto the micro. For example, this might be for protection reasons - hackers might be able to access parts of the device that weren't meant to be accessed. One way of stopping this is to add encryption. The company can add their own secret signature to the firmware code and encrypt it with a secret key. Then, the bootloader can decrypt the incoming firmware and confirm that the incoming firmware is correctly signed. Users will not know the secret key or the signature tied to the firmware, so they won't be able to \"fake\" their own."

    "Simply put, we've got a target device running an encrypted bootloader (a program used to upload new code onto a device) and we want to see if we can get our own code running on the device. We've done a bit of sniffing on the serial lines when the device's firmware is being updated and we've learned the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The device communicates over serial at 38400bps\n",
    "* When writing memory, the first byte is always zero (probably a command byte)\n",
    "* There's a 16 byte block of random looking memory (aka it doesn't look like firmware). This part is probably encrypted\n",
    "* There's a 2 byte CRC at the end of each message\n",
    "* There's no repetition in the ciphertext.\n",

    "1. We can see operations in the encryption being repeated. This looks a lot like AES - we can see a long distinct operation that's probably MixColumns in there and the overall structure looks a lot like what we saw when looking at TINYAES128C encryptions. Let's make a weak assumption that this is AES128 - we can adjust this as we learn more about the bootloader.\n",

We can still attack AES256 without much issue: we basically just have to run two CPA attacks, one for the first half of the key and another for the second half.

It's pretty unlikely that this device is using straight AES256 (if it even is using AES256), since firmware usually has blocks that repeat. More likely is that AES is being used as a stream cipher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation. This could pose an immediate problem for our attack efforts: we need to know either what's going into or coming out of the AES block to perform a CPA attack. However, some of the modes listed on that page (if it's even using one on that page) feed an IV or a counter into that block instead of the plaintext or the ciphertext. We didn't see any encryption operations happening on startup (which the device could've done if it was using one of these IV/counter modes), so we'll probably be okay with a normal CPA attack.
