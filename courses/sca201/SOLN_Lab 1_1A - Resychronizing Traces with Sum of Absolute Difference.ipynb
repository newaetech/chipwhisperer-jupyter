    "**SUMMARY:** *At the end of SCA101, you saw how the communication lines of a microcontroller can be used as a trigger in a side channel attack. This attack was made much more difficult by the presence of jitter; the traces didn't all line up with each other. One thing you might have asked after that lab was if jitter can be used as a countermeasure to a CPA attack. If our target introduces enough jitter, will our CPA attack become impractical?*\n",

This means we won't have to figure out how to deal with the parts of the trace that are shifted outside the capture window.\n",

In practise, we can skip finding all the offsets and just use the first offset that falls below a threshold like we did in the password bypass.

With two uses of SAD under your belt, you should start to see how it is a useful metric for comparing two power traces, as it is both simple and effective. If you're looking for another usecase for SAD in the ChipWhisperer project, we also have it available as a trigger for the CW1200. This allows you to trigger based on the shape of a wave. In the case of our simple attack, it would completely remove the need for a trigger pin!"
