    "**SUMMARY:** *In the last lab, we looked at a simple method for resynchronizing traces: the Sum of Absolute Difference. This technique was enough to defeat the simple jitter between the device triggering and it performing an encryption. In this lab, we'll look at a device with jitter during the actual encryption operation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this lab, we'll look at how jitter-based countermeasures can be overcome by resynchronizing the traces. More specifically, we'll use the sum of absolute difference (SAD) measure that we last looked at early on in SCA101.* \n",
