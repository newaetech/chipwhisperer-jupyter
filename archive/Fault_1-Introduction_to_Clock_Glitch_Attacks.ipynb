    "The phase shift blocks use the Digital Clock Manager (DCM) blocks within the FPGA. These blocks have limited support for run-time configuration of parameters such as phase delay and frequency generation, and for maximum performance the configuration must be fixed at design time. The Xilinx-provided run-time adjustment can shift the phase only by about +/- 5nS in 30pS increments (exact values vary with operating conditions).\n",

    "For most operating conditions this is insufficient - if attacking a target at 7.37MHz the clock cycle would have a period of 136nS. In order to provide a larger adjustment range, an advanced FPGA feature called Partial Reconfiguration (PR) is used. The PR system requires special partial bitstreams which contain modifications to the FPGA bitstream. These are stored as two files inside a \"firmware\" zip which contains both the FPGA bitstream along with a file called `glitchwidth.p` and a file called `glitchoffset.p`. If a lone bitstream is being loaded into the FPGA (i.e. not from the zip-file), the partial reconfiguration system is disabled, as loading incorrect partial reconfiguration files could damage the FPGA. This damage is mostly theoretical, more likely the FPGA will fail to function correctly.\n",

To save time, pick a `width` and `offset` that worked for you and only vary `ext_offset`. Note that even with the right parameters and location, inserting a glitch won't always work, so a better strategy may be to loop infinitely over `ext_offset` values until you get a successful glitch.\n",

    "One thing that you may have run into in the previous part is that using a large repeat value makes the target more likely to crash. As mentioned in the previous part, we can use smaller ranges of offset and width, use a repeat value of 1, and iterate through the external offset instead to get a successful glitch. This is often a much more reliable way to glitch targets.\n",

    "One other thing we need to consider is crashing. In the previous part, we didn't need to worry about crashing since we always reset after a glitch attempt anyway. This is no longer true. Instead we'll need to detect crashes and, if they happen, reset the target. Typically a good way to detect crashes is by running through the loop again and looking for a timeout. This is rather slow, but for this attack, we don't really have a better method. One thing we can do to speed this up is to decrease the adc timeout value (via `scope.adc.timeout`). Resetting is the same in the last part.\n",
