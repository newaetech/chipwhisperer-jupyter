# ARCHIVED: USE AT OWN RISK

This folder contains all of the CW5 jupyter files. If you'd like to try them
out and have jupyter installed, you can run `jupyter notebook` (or `jupyter
labs`) in this directory.

The suggested order of completion is in the notebook file
`!!Suggested_Completion_Order!!`

Though not necessary, it's recommended that you install
[nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)
and enable `Table of Contents` and `Collapsible Headings`, since it will make
navigating the tutorials easier (especially for B2).

If you're using extensions,
[nbextensions_configuator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)
adds a GUI in Jupyter for enabling/disabling extensions.
